    	    <h1>LLaMA and How It Works (llama.cpp)</h1>

<p>By: <a href="https://github.com/w1ldc4rd-w1z4rd">w1ldc4rd-w1z4rd</a></p>

<h3>What is LLaMA?</h3>

<p>LLaMA stands for Large Language Model Architecture. It's a type of AI that's really good at understanding and creating text that sounds like it was written by a human. You can use LLaMA for things like finishing sentences, summarizing articles, translating languages, and answering questions. What makes LLaMA special is that it can handle a lot of information and still work efficiently.</p>

<h3>What's llama.cpp?</h3>

<p><strong>llama.cpp</strong> is a special set of tools, written in a programming language called C++, that's designed to work with LLaMA models really well. It's made to be super fast and to work on different kinds of computers, whether you're using a big server in a data center or just your laptop at home. Georgi Gerganov, who's known for his work in machine learning and signal processing, is the brain behind <strong>llama.cpp</strong>.</p>

<h3>How Does GGML Fit In?</h3>

<p>GGML stands for Georgi Gerganov's Machine Learning library. It's a bunch of basic building blocks for machine learning, kind of like the Lego pieces you need to build something cool. It works hand-in-hand with <strong>llama.cpp</strong> to make sure LLaMA models can do their job efficiently.</p>
