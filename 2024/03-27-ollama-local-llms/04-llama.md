# Getting to Know LLaMA and How It Works in llama.cpp

### What is LLaMA?

LLaMA stands for Large Language Model Architecture. It's a type of AI that's really good at understanding and creating text that sounds like it was written by a human. You can use LLaMA for things like finishing sentences, summarizing articles, translating languages, and answering questions. What makes LLaMA special is that it can handle a lot of information and still work efficiently.

### What's llama.cpp?

`llama.cpp` is a special set of tools, written in a programming language called C++, that's designed to work with LLaMA models really well. It's made to be super fast and to work on different kinds of computers, whether you're using a big server in a data center or just your laptop at home. Georgi Gerganov, who's known for his work in machine learning and signal processing, is the brain behind `llama.cpp`.

### How Does GGML Fit In?

GGML stands for Georgi Gerganov's Machine Learning library. It's a bunch of basic building blocks for machine learning, kind of like the Lego pieces you need to build something cool. It works hand-in-hand with `llama.cpp` to make sure LLaMA models can do their job efficiently.
