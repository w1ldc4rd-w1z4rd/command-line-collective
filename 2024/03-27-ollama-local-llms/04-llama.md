# Getting to Know LLaMA and How It Works in llama.cpp

By: [w1ldc4rd-w1z4rd](https://github.com/w1ldc4rd-w1z4rd)

### What is LLaMA?

LLaMA stands for Large Language Model Architecture. It's a type of AI that's really good at understanding and creating text that sounds like it was written by a human. You can use LLaMA for things like finishing sentences, summarizing articles, translating languages, and answering questions. What makes LLaMA special is that it can handle a lot of information and still work efficiently.

### Why Was LLaMA Created?

Researchers and engineers made LLaMA to help push forward the field of natural language processing (NLP), which is all about getting computers to understand and use human language. They wanted to give everyone a powerful tool that can be used for all sorts of language tasks, whether it's for studying languages in a university or for building apps that can chat with you. By sharing LLaMA with everyone, they hoped to spark more teamwork and new ideas in the world of NLP.

### What's llama.cpp?

`llama.cpp` is a special set of tools, written in a programming language called C++, that's designed to work with LLaMA models really well. It's made to be super fast and to work on different kinds of computers, whether you're using a big server in a data center or just your laptop at home. Georgi Gerganov, who's known for his work in machine learning and signal processing, is the brain behind `llama.cpp`.

### How Does GGML Fit In?

GGML stands for Georgi Gerganov's Machine Learning library. It's a bunch of basic building blocks for machine learning, kind of like the Lego pieces you need to build something cool. It works hand-in-hand with `llama.cpp` to make sure LLaMA models can do their job efficiently.

### Why Are llama.cpp and GGML Shared with Everyone?

The people who made `llama.cpp` and GGML decided to share them with the world for free because they want to help the community grow and innovate. By making these tools open source, they're inviting other developers and researchers to join in, try things out, and come up with new ways to use LLaMA models. It's all about bringing people together to make progress in understanding and working with human language.
