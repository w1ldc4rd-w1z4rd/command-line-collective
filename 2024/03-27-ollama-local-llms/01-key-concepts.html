    	    <h1>Key Concepts:</h1>

<p>By: <a href="https://github.com/w1ldc4rd-w1z4rd">w1ldc4rd-w1z4rd</a></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Large Language Model (LLM)</strong>: Think of it as a super-smart computer program that can read, understand, and write text like a human. It's used for tasks like translating between languages, summarizing articles, and chatting with users.</li>
<li><strong>Transformer</strong>: This is the brain behind LLMs. It's a special way of organizing the AI's calculations, allowing it to pay attention to important words in a sentence while ignoring less important ones. It's like having a spotlight that focuses on the key parts of a conversation.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer">Tokenization</a></strong>: Just like breaking a sentence into individual words, tokenization breaks text into smaller chunks (tokens) so the LLM can understand it. Each token is like a puzzle piece that the LLM puts together to understand the whole picture.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-Tuning</strong>: Imagine you have a general-purpose tool, and you adjust it slightly to perform a specific task better. Fine-tuning is like that but for LLMs. It's tweaking a pre-trained LLM to make it better at a particular job, like translating a specific language or answering questions about a certain topic.</li>
<li><strong>Prompts</strong>: When you talk to an LLM, you give it prompts, which are like conversation starters or questions. Based on these prompts, the LLM generates a response or completes a task.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Local LLaMA and Ollama Related Concepts:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>LLaMA (Large Language Model Architecture)</strong>: A set of LLMs designed to be efficient and flexible, allowing them to be scaled up or down depending on the task. It's like having a toolkit with different-sized tools for different jobs.</li>
<li><strong>llama.cpp</strong>: A software library written in C++ that helps run LLaMA models efficiently on various devices, from powerful servers to everyday laptops. It's like a high-performance engine that powers the LLM.</li>
<li><strong>Ollama</strong>: A tool that makes it easier to run LLMs like LLaMA on your own computer. It packages everything you need ‚Äì the AI model, its settings, and the data it uses ‚Äì so you can use it without needing a cloud service.</li>
<li><strong>ModelFile</strong>: In Ollama, this is a file that tells the LLM how to behave when it gets a prompt. It's like a set of instructions or rules that guide the LLM's responses.</li>
<li><strong>SYSTEM</strong>: Within the ModelFile, the SYSTEM directive sets the overall approach or strategy the LLM should follow when responding to prompts. It's like a game plan that outlines how the LLM should play the game of conversation.</li>
</ul>
