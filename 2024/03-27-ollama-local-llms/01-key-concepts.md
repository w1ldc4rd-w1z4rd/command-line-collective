- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: An AI model that processes and generates human-like text, used for tasks like translation, summarization, and chatbots.
- **Transformer**: Architecture used in LLMs, relying on self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data, such as text.
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into smaller pieces (tokens) so the LLM can understand it. Each token is like a word or part of a word.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting a pre-trained LLM for a specific task, like translating languages or answering questions.
- **Prompts**: Questions or instructions you give to an LLM to get it to generate a response.

### Local LLaMA and Ollama Related Concepts:

- **LLaMA (Large Language Model Architecture)**: A series of scalable and efficient transformer-based LLMs for understanding and generating text.
- **llama.cpp**: A C++ library for efficient inference of LLaMA models, designed for high performance across various hardware platforms.
- **Ollama**: A tool that simplifies running open-source LLMs locally by bundling model weights, configurations, and datasets.
- **ModelFile**: A configuration file in Ollama that defines how the LLM should behave when processing prompts. It can include directives that influence the model's responses.
- **SYSTEM**: A directive in the ModelFile that specifies how the model should approach and respond to prompts, based on desired behavior or objectives.
