# Introduction to IRC

Welcome to the world of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) â€“ the ultimate platform for real-time text messaging. Developed by Jarkko Oikarinen in August 1988, IRC stands as a testament to the brilliance of old-school hacker culture. Whether you're looking to join group conversations or engage in private chats, IRC offers unparalleled flexibility and control.

### History and Background

1. **Who Created IRC**:
   - IRC was created by Jarkko Oikarinen in August 1988.
   - It was developed to replace a program called MUT (MultiUser Talk) on the Finnish BBS OuluBox.

2. **What is IRC**:
   - IRC is its own protocol, meaning it defines a standard method for clients and servers to communicate for real-time text messaging.
   - This standardization allows different software implementations to interact seamlessly.

### Why IRC is the Best

1. **Standards-Based Protocol**:
   - Unlike proprietary systems like Discord or Slack, IRC is a standard protocol.
   - Offers numerous server and client options, providing flexibility and independence.

2. **Server Independence**:
   - Users can connect to existing servers or set up their own.
   - No need to rely on third-party servers, granting you full control over your chat environment.

3. **Flexibility and Control**:
   - Run private servers suitable for secure environments, isolated networks, or internal organizational use.
   - Enjoy the freedom from proprietary systems, avoiding the need for creating logins or dealing with third-party services.

4. **Large Community and Support**:
   - Many open-source projects and communities have their channels on IRC.
   - Provides access to support and discussions with developers and other users.

5. **Old-School Hacker Vibes**:
   - Using IRC connects you to the roots of internet communication.
   - Embrace the old-school hacker ethos and become a part of the rich history of the internet.

### How IRC Works

1. **Connecting to a Server**:
   - Use an IRC client to connect to an IRC server, usually on the internet.
   - Multiple clients can connect to the same server, joining various channels.

2. **Joining Channels**:
   - Channels are like chat rooms within the server.
   - Examples of channels could be for specific topics like VLC, Wireshark, or Tall Paul Tech.

3. **Sending Messages**:
   - Messages sent to a channel are distributed by the server to all clients in that channel.
   - Direct messages can be sent to individual users through the server.

4. **File Transfers**:
   - Files can be transferred directly between clients after initial mediation by the server.
   - Configuration may be required to handle firewall issues and ensure successful transfers.

### Setting Up and Configuring IRC

1. **Choosing an IRC Client**:
   - Popular IRC clients include [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/), [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/), and [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com/).
   - **For Android**: Recommended clients available on F-Droid are [Revolution IRC](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.mrarm.irc/) and [Irssi](https://irssi.org/).

2. **Connecting to a Server**:
   - Open the IRC client and connect to the server **clc:6969** using SSL/TLS for a secure connection.
   - Join the channel by typing the command **/join #lounge**.

3. **Sending Messages and Files**:
   - Send messages to the channel or to individual users.
   - For file transfers, specify the file and port number, and ensure the necessary ports are open on your firewall.

4. **Encryption**:
   - For secure communication, use encrypted connections by connecting to the specified port (e.g., 6969 for SSL/TLS connections).
   - Note that file transfers may still be unencrypted even when the connection itself is encrypted.

### Chat History in IRC

1. **No Built-In Chat History**:
   - Unlike modern chat systems, IRC does not store chat history by default.
   - This means once you disconnect, you won't have access to previous messages unless you use logging features.

2. **Logging Options**:
   - Many IRC clients offer logging options to save chat history locally.
   - You can configure your client to save logs for future reference.
