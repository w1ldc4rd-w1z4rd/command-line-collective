# IRC Hacker Old-School Creed

1. **Maintain 100% Uptime!**
   - Our channels never sleep, and neither do we. Stay connected, stay vigilant.

2. **Maximize Privacy, Disable Message History!**
   - No logs, no worries. The past is a mystery, and our privacy is paramount. Be online 24/7 to catch every byte.

3. **Embrace the L33t Speak in Usernames!**
   - Only the true hax0rs understand. Usernames must reflect your inner hacker spirit. Example: **C00lH4x0r**.

4. **Use Minimalistic Clients!**
   - Fancy GUIs are for noobs. Command-line clients like Irssi and Weechat are the tools of the trade.

5. **Script Your Life Away!**
   - Automate everything. From greeting new users to kicking trolls, scripts are your best friends.

6. **Respect the Ops!**
   - Channel operators are the guardians of order. Respect their commands and follow their lead.

7. **Share the Knowledge!**
   - Help the newbies, spread the hax0r wisdom. An IRC channel is only as strong as its community.

8. **Stay Anonymous and Secure!**
   - Use VPNs, proxies, and encryption. Keep your real identity hidden and your data secure.

9. **Master the Commands!**
   - Know your **/join** from your **/kick**. Commands are the language of IRC, and fluency is a must.

10. **Never Use Emojis!**
    - Text-based emoticons only. Keep it old school with :-) and :-P.

11. **Idle is Productive!**
    - Being idle in a channel shows dedication. Your presence is felt even in silence.

12. **Keep the ASCII Art Alive!**
    - Impress your peers with your ASCII art skills. It’s the ultimate form of expression.

13. **Engage in Epic Flame Wars (Responsibly)!**
    - Debate passionately but respect others. Flame wars are a tradition, but never cross the line.

14. **Treasure the Pings and Pongs!**
    - Ping? Pong! The heartbeat of IRC. Acknowledge and cherish these simple, yet crucial, exchanges.

1. **Hail the Bots!**
   - Bots are our loyal companions. Treat them well and they’ll serve you with precision.
